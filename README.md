Development

## ePub validation

This project uses epubcheck to validate the generated ePubs. If the ``build.sh`` script complains when running ``epubcheck``, make sure you have java installed and it's in your PATH.

If you need help running epubcheck read this <a href="http://blog.threepress.org/2010/12/16/running-epubcheck-on-your-computer/">step-by-step guide</a>.

## Using the check script to validate the book.

It's supereasy. Just do:

    ./check book.epub

This project currently uses EpubCheck version 3.0.1.


## Style

*Caveat lector*: currently there aren't any defined styles. While I add a basic layout have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/mattharrison/epub-css-starter-kit">ePub CSS Starter Kit</a>.

## ePub â†’ mobi

Here's what you can do if you want to transform your ``.epub`` file to ``.mobi``:

1. Download [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211).
2. Uncompress the file.
3. Copy the ``kindlegen`` executable to the ``bin`` folder.
4. Run ``./bin/kindlegen book.epub``.
