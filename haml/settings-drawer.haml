        %img{alt: "Settings Drawer", src: "../images/settings-drawer.png"}

        %p The drawer is divided into two parts.

        %h2 &#9312; Setting recording time

        %p You can define the duration of a recording before and even during a recording.

        .per3 In the upper field, you can enter a value defining the complete duration of the recording. Please note that this value is in minutes.

        .hint Caution: If adjusting the duration during a recording, the minutes specified do not represent the complete recording. Instead they represent the remaining time of recording.

        %h2 &#9313; Choosing upload channel

        %p In the channel list &#9314;, you choose in which channel you want your clip to be added.

        %p If you have many channels, you can search within them using the search field &#9315;.

        %p
          If you see no channels listed or you are missing one, you can click on the "More Channels..." button. A popup window will open and ask you to sign in using SWITCHaai. Once you have successfully logged in, you will see the channel list getting populated with your channels.
