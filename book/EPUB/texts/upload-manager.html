          <h1>Upload Manager</h1>
        </div>
        <p>In the upload manager you can - the name says it all - manage and upload your completed recordings.</p>
        <p>The upload manager can be opened by clicking on the 'Upload' button in the recorder interface. If you have recordings waiting to be uploaded, this button will have a red badge telling the number of pending recordings.</p>

        <h2>Components of the Upload Manager</h2>
        <h3>&#9312; Filter and Search Bar</h3>
        This bar allows you to search for specific recordings. By clicking on the texts on the left, you can filter your recording by status:
        <ul class='pretty'>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>All:</strong>
              Show all recordings
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Ready to upload:</em>
            Show only recordings that are not yet uploaded
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Completed:</em>
            Show only recordings that have been successfullly uploaded
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The drawer is divided into two parts.</p>
        <p>You can define the duration of a recording before and even during a recording.</p>
        <div class='per3'>In the upper field, you can enter a value defining the complete duration of the recording. Please note that this value is in minutes.</div>
        <div class='hint'>Caution: If adjusting the duration during a recording, the minutes specified do not represent the complete recording. Instead they represent the remaining time of recording.</div>
        <h2>&#9313; Choosing upload channel</h2>
        <p>In the channel list &#9314;, you choose in which channel you want your clip to be added.</p>
        <p>If you have many channels, you can search within them using the search field &#9315;.</p>
        <p>
          If you see no channels listed or you are missing one, you can click on the "More Channels..." button. A popup window will open and ask you to sign in using SWITCHaai. Once you have successfully logged in, you will see the channel list getting populated with your channels.
