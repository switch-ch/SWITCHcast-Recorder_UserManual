        <p>In the setting drawer you can configure and define the values of the current recording.</p>
        <p>The drawer can be opened by clicking on the 'Change' button in the recorder interface.</p>
        <img alt='Settings Drawer' src='../images/settings-drawer.png' />
        <p>The drawer is divided into two parts.</p>
        <h2 class='subheader'>&#9312; Setting recording time</h2>
        <p>You can define the duration of a recording before and even during a recording.</p>
        <div class='per3'>In the upper field, you can enter a value defining the complete duration of the recording. Please note that this value is in minutes.</div>
        <div class='hint'>Caution: If adjusting the duration during a recording, the minutes specified do not represent the complete recording. Instead they represent the remaining time of recording.</div>
        <h2 class='subheader'>&#9313; Choosing upload channel</h2>
        <p>In the channel list &#9314;, you choose in which channel you want your clip to be added.</p>
        <p>If you have many channels, you can search within them using the search field &#9315;.</p>
        <p>
          If you see no channels listed or you are missing one, you can click on the "More Channels..." button. A popup window will open and ask you to sign in using SWITCHaai. Once you have successfully logged in, you will see the channel list getting populated with your channels.
